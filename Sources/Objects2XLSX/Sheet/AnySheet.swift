/**
 A type-erased wrapper for sheets that can hold any object type.

 `AnySheet` enables storing sheets with different object types in the same collection,
 which is essential for the `Book` class to manage multiple worksheets. It preserves
 the functionality of the original typed sheet while hiding the specific object type.

 ## Overview

 Type erasure is necessary because Swift generics don't allow storing different
 generic types in the same collection. `AnySheet` solves this by:

 - Wrapping the typed `Sheet<ObjectType>` functionality
 - Providing a uniform interface for sheet operations
 - Maintaining type safety through closure capture
 - Enabling polymorphic behavior for sheet processing

 ## Usage

 ```swift
 let peopleSheet = Sheet<Person>(name: "People") { ... }
 let productSheet = Sheet<Product>(name: "Products") { ... }

 // Store different sheet types together
 let sheets: [AnySheet] = [
     peopleSheet.eraseToAnySheet(),
     productSheet.eraseToAnySheet()
 ]

 // Process all sheets uniformly
 for sheet in sheets {
     let meta = sheet.makeSheetMeta(sheetId: index)
     // ... process sheet
 }
 ```

 ## Implementation Details

 The type erasure is implemented using closure capture to preserve the original
 sheet's functionality while providing a common interface. All operations delegate
 to the wrapped sheet through stored closures.

 - Note: This class is used internally by the library and rarely needs direct instantiation

     ## Implementation

     The initializer captures references to the sheet's methods and properties,
     allowing the `AnySheet` to delegate operations to the original typed sheet
     without exposing the object type.

     Loads data from the wrapped sheet's data provider.

     This method is called explicitly by the `Book` class to ensure data is loaded
     exactly once during the Excel generation process. It delegates to the wrapped
     sheet's `loadData()` method.

     - Note: This method is internal and called by the framework during Excel generation
     */

     Generates the XML representation of this worksheet.

     This method uses data that has already been loaded via `loadData()`.
     It creates the complete XML structure for the worksheet including headers,
     data rows, and styling information. The method accesses pre-loaded data
     rather than calling the data provider again, ensuring efficient single-pass processing.

     - Parameters:
        - bookStyle: The workbook-level styling configuration
        - styleRegister: Registry for managing and deduplicating styles
        - shareStringRegister: Registry for managing shared strings

     - Returns: A `SheetXML` object containing the complete worksheet XML, or `nil` if generation fails

     - Important: This method assumes data has been pre-loaded through `loadData()`.
       It uses the cached data rather than calling the data provider to avoid duplicate loading.
     - Note: This method is internal and called by the framework during Excel generation
